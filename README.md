This would be the first generated image of my raytracer. As you can see it is very barebones and I was able to take the data and implement it as a ppm file that I can open on gimp. The way this image was constructed was using a custom created projectile and environment structs that is passed into a tick function to demonstrate movement with certain wind and gravity options.
